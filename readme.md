## How to set up OBS
In order for all of these to work, you **MUST** launch with the .lnk file attached. This removes CORS, which allows 
for the widgets to communicate with VStream and retrieve the data needed for these to work.

## How to install
Please install the entire source folder of this GitHub repository, and extract into an easily accessible folder.
For each widget, please configure and drag each widget.html file into OBS studio 
Once dragged, widgets will work immediately!

> Individual instructions per-widget along with previews are available in their respective folders!
