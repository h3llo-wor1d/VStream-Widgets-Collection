# How to use

## Configuring
- Change the values in `options.js` to your liking, almost all values have comments if they are not self-explanatory.
- You **have** to set username to your vstream username (i.e. mine is h3llo_wor1d)

## Future Changes Planned
- Since this is based VERY closely on the streamelements chat box, you will be able to change themes in the future.
