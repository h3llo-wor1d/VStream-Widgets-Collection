# How to use

## Configuring
- change the values in `options.js` to your liking
- username should be your actual vstream username (i.e. mine is h3llo_wor1d)

## Using
- you must launch obs with the lnk file provided for it to work
- this is because CORS fucking ruins everything, and this lnk file turns it off
- in order to use this widget in obs, you must drag the html file in once everything is configured!
- will work immediately
